# Magic: The Binding
A fan-made (bootleg) play format to wrap Magic: The Gathering in a ttrpg layer inspired by the style of divination and card readings.

Gameplay elements you can expect:
=
- Deckbuilding/modified drafting
- Linking card symbolism to narrative experience
- Theatre-of-the-Mind relation of events, relationships and conflicts to cards and mechanics
- Well-defined starting and ending points for each arc
- Partially asymmetric gameplay (the GM-like role mirrors the other players' while still doing the "one player represents the rest of the world to the other players" thing)


What You Need:
=
- Your own cards, people to play with, etcetera



This Is a Bootleg

Magic: The Binding is entirely a product of my own personal obsession and need to work out my own thoughts on gaming in general, and the challenge of successfully turning a CCG experience into a TTRPG experience, in particular. I do this with no permission of any kind from Wizards of the Coast, much as one would expect a fan artist to draw their own art portraying M:tG intellectual property, make memes about the same, and otherwise practice creativity around the source material owned by WotC.
As such, I have elected to make the rules of this format available under The Unlicense and thereby (I hope) ensure we can all play nice about it.

But please be assured, this work only represents that weird person's efforts to work through their stuff by making a game about it. This isn't an enterprise, y'all, it's just my art therapy. If its fruits interest you, they're yours to check out, branch or whatever.

So there.
