# magic-the-binding
A fan-made (bootleg) play format to wrap Magic: The Gathering in a ttrpg layer inspired by the style of divination and card readings.

Gameplay elements you can expect:
=
- Deckbuilding/modified drafting
- Linking card symbolism to narrative experience
- Theatre-of-the-Mind relation of events, relationships and conflicts to cards and mechanics
- Well-defined starting and ending points for each arc
- Partially asymmetric gameplay (the GM-like role mirrors the other players' while still doing the "one player represents the rest of the world to the other players" thing)
=
What You Need:
=
- Your own cards, people to play with, etcetera
